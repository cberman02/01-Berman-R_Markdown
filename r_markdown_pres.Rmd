## What is R Markdown

- A way of creating documents with chunks of code, visualizations, etc. embedded into it
- Relies on two packages: knitr and Pandoc
  + knitr allows for the code to be embedded in the markdown document
  + Pandoc allows for the document to be exported in multiple file formats

## Benefits

- Simplicity (allegedly)
- Can cover several functions
- Cannot do everything (in-depth typesetting)

##
- Convenient way to create documents with good formatting

## 
- Can also be used to create websites
![Website Example.](/Users/charlesberman/Desktop/Econ368/R_markdown_presentation/Website_ex.png)

##
- And dashboards
![Dash Example.](/Users/charlesberman/Desktop/Econ368/R_markdown_presentation/dash_ex.png)

## 
- We can also embed code right into the program

```{r echo = FALSE}
set.seed = 8675309

one_run_stock <- function(t = 0.5, mean_a = 0.15, sd_a = 0.2, mean_b = 0.12, 
                          sd_b = 0.18, stock_a = 100, stock_b = 75, n_a = 100, 
                          n_b = 100, nrep = 100){
  one_estimate <- rep(0, times = nrep)
  initial_wealth <- n_a * stock_a + n_b * stock_b
  
  for(i in 1:nrep){
    b_a = rnorm(1, sd = sqrt(t))
    b_b = rnorm(1, sd = sqrt(t))
    stock_a_t <- stock_a * exp((mean_a - sd_a^2/2)*t + sd_a*b_a)
    stock_b_t <- stock_b * exp((mean_b - sd_b^2/2)*t + sd_b*b_b)
    loss_event = (n_a * stock_a_t + n_b * stock_b_t)/(n_a * stock_a + n_b * stock_b)
    if(loss_event <= 0.9) one_estimate[i] <- 1
  }
  return(one_estimate)
}

draw_hist <- function(n = 100, t = 0.5){
  full_estimates <- rep(0, times = n)
  for(i in 1:n){
    full_estimates[i] <- mean(one_run_stock(t = t))
  }
  hist(full_estimates, freq = FALSE, ylim = c(0,30), xlim = c(0,0.12), 
       main = paste("Monte Carlo Sim with", n, "Runs and", t, "Time"))
  text(mean(full_estimates), 25, round(mean(full_estimates),3))
  abline(v = mean(full_estimates), col = "red", lwd = 2)
  abline(v=quantile(full_estimates,c(0.05,0.95)), col = "green", lwd = 2)
}

par(mfrow = c(3,2))
draw_hist()
draw_hist(n = 1000)
draw_hist(n = 10000)
draw_hist(n = 10000, t = 0.75)
draw_hist(n = 10000, t = 1)
draw_hist(n = 10000, t = 2)
```

##
- This is the code used for the previous plots

## All Uses
-Convert R Markdown into multiple file types

-Create notebooks with interactive code (similar to Jupyter notebook)

-Make presentations (like this one)

-Create dashboards

-Shiny apps (Shiny is a package for creating websites in R)

-Journal articles

-Write books

-Create websites

## How to Get Started

-First, open a new 'R Markdown' File
![Step 1.](/Users/charlesberman/Desktop/Econ368/R_markdown_presentation/step_1.png)

##
-Next, choose the option you would like to use
  + Document
  + Presentation
  + Shiny App
  + From Template
  
![Step 2.](/Users/charlesberman/Desktop/Econ368/R_markdown_presentation/step_2.png)

##
- Add new chunks and text
  + Chunks have the code, text is the text you see in the document
